Securing Website using Steganography, IPS, and IDS

This project demonstrates how to secure a website using three cybersecurity techniques: Steganography, Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). It combines front-end and back-end components to detect and prevent unauthorized access while securely transmitting hidden data.

 🔐 Features

- Steganography (Encryption & Decryption) 
  Hides sensitive data inside images to ensure secure transmission.

- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)  
  Monitors and logs suspicious activities on the site.

- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
  Actively prevents malicious actions by redirecting or blocking users.

- Fake Login Page 
  A trap page (honeypot) to lure attackers and record login attempts.

- Error Page Redirection 
  Ensures attackers are misled or blocked from accessing core resources.
